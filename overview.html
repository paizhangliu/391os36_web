<h3 id="fs">File System</h3>
<p>
    The 391OS-36 File System has a total size of 8MB, and is divided into 4KB blocks of one boot block, several inodes, and data blocks.<br>
    Each boot block can track up to 62 inodes and one root directory, and each inode can track up to 1023 data blocks.<br>
    Thus, the limitations are up to 62 files of 4092KB size and 32 characters name length. Also, it does not support hierarchy and is read-only.
</p>
<h3 id="fsabst">File System Abstraction</h3>
<p>
    The 391OS-36 treat any files, device (RTC), and directory as files (see <a href="#fsdir">File System Directory</a>). Each process has a dynamic File Descriptor (FD) that supports 8 open files.<br>
    Each FD entry tracks inode, position, flags, and an operation jump table, according to the file type. They are directly utilized by system calls (see <a href="#syscall">System Calls</a>).<br>

<h3 id="linkage">Context Switch/Assembly Linkages</h3>
<p>
    Whenever an interruption, exception, or system call happened, the processor jumps to a specific assmebly linkage in the kernel space.<br>
    This procedure is sometimes called a <b>"context switch"</b>. It is almost constantly happening with the scheduler enabled, as the OS schedules the next program.<br>
    Assembly linkages for interruption, exception, and system calls are different, but they all construct a hardware context on the kernel stack for restoring or usage.<br>
    They will also push/pass through arguments accordingly, and call the corresponding handlers (see <a href="#exception">Exception Handlers</a>, <a href="#int">Interrupt Handlers</a>, and <a href="#syscall">System Calls</a>).<br>
    When returning back from the handler, assembly linkage will resume the hardware context saved before by IRET, then go back to the user space.<br>
    Or, halt/execute/process switch (see <a href="#proctrl">Execute/Halt</a> and <a href="#scheduler">Switch</a>) constructs a custom context, then it will jump to the next program's Prgram Counter (PC) and stack.<br>
    <i>When going back to the user space, it will also dispatches any pending signal (see <a href="#sig">Signals</a>, this is optional).</i><br>
    <i>Now, you see the reason why context switch is <b>expensive</b>. The assembly linkage really needs to deal with a lot of stuff.</i>
</p>
<h3 id="exception">Exception/Exception Handlers</h3>
<p>
    An exception happens when the user program did something wild, such as dividing by zero or accessing illegal pages.<br>
    Exceptions are synchronised. When an exception was generated, the processor jumps to the specific assembly linkage (see <a href="#linkage">Assembly Linkages</a>).<br>
    The exception assembly linkage pushes information and calls an unified exception handler.<br>
    Then, the handler will display the error message, debug information, and <i>send a signal to the process for further handling (see <a href="#sig">Signals</a>, this is optional)</i>.<br>
    If you did not implement the signal or no handler was installed, the default behavior is usually killing/halting the offending program.
</p>
<h3 id="int">Interrupt/Interrupt Handlers</h3>
<p>
    An interrupt happens when a piece of hardware needs processor's attention, such as keyboard input, RTC, and PIC.<br>
    The 391OS-36 only contains essential drivers (see <a href="#dev">Supported Devices/Drivers</a>). Interrupt lines (IRQs) from non-supported hardware are masked and ignored.<br>
    The IRQ lines are managed by two i8259 PICs just like any other mainstream IBM-compatible PC.<br>
    Interrupts are non-synchronised. When an interrupt is raised and got processor's attention, it jumps to the specific assembly linkage (see <a href="#linkage">Assembly Linkages</a>).<br>
    The interrupt assmebly linkage pushes information and calls an unified interrupt handler.<br>
    Then, the handler will call the corresponding driver, and the driver will handle the remaining work (again, see <a href="#dev">Supported Devices/Drivers</a>).

<h3 id="dev">Supported Devices/Drivers</h3>
<p>
    The 391OS-36 has drivers for the standard keyboard, Programmable Interval Timer (PIT), Real-Time Clock (RTC), and terminal.<br>
    Keyboard, PIT, and RTC drivers are for real devices and contains handlers for their interrupts (see <a href="#int">Interrupt/Interrupt Handlers</a>).<br>
    The standard keyboard driver is responsible servicing key presses, and it also has support for the capital letter and combinational key handling.<br>
    The PIT and RTC all generates interrupts periodically.<br>
    The PIT and PIT driver are used to handle the scheduling and can be turned off (see <a href="#scheduler">Process Switching/Scheduler</a>). It is only accessible by the 391OS-36 kernel.<br>
    The RTC is user-level accessible and it is "virtualized" for each process by the RTC driver, so they all have its own instance and frenquency.<br>
    <i>Now, you see why the OS should use PIT for its task scheduling. You don't want an user program to adjust the scheduler frequency in the kernel.</i><br>
    The terminal driver is for standard input and output and works as a bridge with each terminal, keyboard driver, and system calls.<br>
    There are three terminals (see <a href="#multerm">Background Switching/Multiterminals</a>). The input buffer for each terminal is limited to 128-characters.<br>
</p>
<h3 id="memaddr">Memory Addressing</h3>
<p>
    The 391OS-36 has bypassed segmentation just like any mainstream modern operation systems. Only paging was used for the memory addressing.<br>
    The memory layout 391OS-36 used is fixed (see <a href="#pmem">Physical Memory Layout</a> and <a href="#vmem">Virtual Memory Layout</a>).<br>
</p>
<h3 id="pmem">Physical Memory Layout</h3>
<p>
    From low to high, the 391OS-36 has utilized the following 32MB physical memory:<br>
    <ul>
        <li>4MB space with five 4KB space for the VRAM for the active terminal, 3 terminal backups, and an extra backup space (see <a href="#multerm">Multiterminals</a>)</li>
        <li>4MB space for the kernel data (mostly Process Control Blocks (PCBs) and Terminal Info (TI) blocks) and kernel stack (see <a href="#proctrl">Process Control</a> and <a href="#multerm">Multiterminals</a>)</li>
        <li>Six 4MB spaces for user applications' binary and stack (see <a href="#proctrl">Process Control</a>)</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3 id="vmem">Virtual Memory Layout</h3>
<p>
    From low to high, the 391OS-36 has mapped the 4GB virtual memory space for each user program as following:<br>
    <ul>
        <li>4MB managed by a superviser Page Table (PT), with five 4KB superviser pages, going through from the physical memory (see <a href="#pmem">Physical Memory Layout</a>)</li>
        <li>4MB superviser jumbo page for the kernel, going through from the physical memory (see <a href="#pmem">Physical Memory Layout</a>)</li>
        <li>4MB user page at address address 128MB, for the current running program only (see <a href="#proctrl">Process Control</a>)</li>
        <li>4MB managed by a user PT, with a 4KB vidmap page for the current active program, controlled by the vidmap (see <a href="#syscall">System Calls</a> and <a href="#multerm">Multiterminals</a>)</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3 id="syscall">System Calls</h3>

<p>
    <i>Please note that the last two system calls are for extra credit; they are not required.</i><br>
    System calls are generated deliberately by user programs by generating a "soft interrupt," INT x80 on x86 systems.<br>
    When a system call was generated, the processor jumps to the system call assembly linkage (see <a href="#linkage">Context Switch/Assembly Linkages</a>).<br>
    Arguments for system calls are carried by %EAX, %EBX, %ECX, and %EDX registers.<br>
    The linkage will check if the arguments are valid, and then hand the job to the corresponding system call handler.
</p>
<h3 id="proctrl">Process Control/Execute/Halt</h3>
<p>
    The 391OS-36 supports up to 6 processes. In the kernel space, each process holds a kernel stack and a <b>Process Control Block (PCB)</b>.<br>
    In the user space, each process holds their own user page (see <a href="#vmem">Virtual Memory Layout</a>) which contains the executable binary and a user stack.<br>
    By having their own kernel and user stacks, their hardware context and user stack data won't be overwritten by other programs.<br>
    Each PCB tracks the allocated process ID (PID), parent PID, terminal ID, kernel/user stacks, FD, <i>signals and its handlers,</i> etc.<br>
    The kernel manages the PCB allocation by a custom design called <i>PCB pool</i>.<br>
    This custom design allows the 391OS-36 to allocate and free the PCB resources freely.<br>
    When <b>creating a new process (execute system call, see <a href="#syscall">System Calls</a>)</b>, the OS will first run a sanity check, extract the program name and argument.<br>
    Then, it will try to allocate a PCB, create the user page and copy the binary for the program, initialize the FD, and do the bookkeeping.<br>
    Finally, it will switch the kernel stack, build a custom hardware context with the new PC and user stack, and return to the linkage (see <a href="#linkage">Assembly Linkages</a>).<br>
    When <b>halting a process (halt system call, see <a href="#syscall">System Calls</a>)</b>, the OS will first free the resources, which will tear down the user page, vidmap, and purge the FD.<br>
    Then, it will free the PCB, build the context with the parent process's information and return to the linkage. Current context will be discarded.
</p>
<h3 id="scheduler">Process Switching/Scheduler</h3>
<p>
    The 391OS-36 supports a round-robin scheduler based on the PIT interrupt (see <a href="#dev">Supported Devices/Drivers</a>) that can be turned off.<br>
    While 6 processes are supported, only 3 of them are actually multitasking, and 1 at each time is running/scheduled.<br>
    The scheduler schedules 3 processes that is shown on each terminal, called active processes, so they are constantly switching, and thus can multitask.<br>
    But only one program is "actually" running, called running process, as there are only one processor supported.<br>
    The <b>program switching</b> begins in the kernel with the hardware context saved. It is pretty like a halt call, but it will preserve the current resources and context.<br>
    Then, it will switch the kernel page, kernel and stack, build the context with the next scheduled process's information and return to the linkage (see <a href="#linkage">Assembly Linkages</a>).<br>
    Turning off scheduler will disable the multitasking, but it mimics the environment for your work prior to CP5.<br>
    In that case, program switching only happens when the user is switching the terminal in the foreground, thus limiting the multitasking features.
</p>
<h3 id="multerm">Background Switching/Multiterminals</h3>
<p>
    The 391OS-36 supports up to 3 terminals. Each terminal holds a custom design called <i><b>terminal info (TI) block</b></i> in the kernel.<br>
    Each <i>TI block</i> tracks the current active program, PCB pointer, coordinations, etc. Scheduler works on active programs, so it relys on these information.<br>
    When <b>switching the running program in the background</b>, a lot of extra works were done. One of the big challenge is to do a switch with separate VRAMs.<br>
    The background running process only prints to its terminal even it is not active. For 391OS-36, this is done by having 5 individual VRAM pages (see <a href="#pmem">Physical Memory Layout</a>).<br>
    When <b>switching the active terminal</b>, 391OS-36 will backup the current VRAM, copy the corresponding VRAM to the display, and remap the vidmap if necessary.<br>

    <p>
        The first five signals supports a custom user-installed handler through set_handler system call.<br>
        You will need to implement the first five to be eligible to receive extra credit for the signals in your MP assignment.<br>
        Linkage is carefully engineered to construct the stack, so signals are checked and delivered during any context switch (see <a href="#linkage">Context Switch/Assembly Linkages</a>).<br>
        Signal requires a lot of bookkeeping including masks, handlers, pending signals in the PCB of each process.

    <h3 id="pmgr">Process Manager</h3>
    <p>
        The 391OS-36 Process Manager is a kernel utility that prints the current PCB Pool and TI block information:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>PID, the Process ID</li>
            <li>TID, the Terminal ID</li>
            <li>PPID, the Parent Process ID</li>
            <li>KSP, the Kernel Stack Pointer</li>
            <li>FD, the File Descriptor</li>
            <li>ECHO, the echo flag</li>
            <li>VMAP, the vidmap flag</li>
            <li>COOR, the cursor coordination</li>
            <li>... and also, the (active, for each terminal) program name</li>
        </ul>
        It is design specific to 391OS-36, so it is definiately not required.<br>
        Please note this utility's kill function does not work with the scheduler (please check other known issues in the demo page).<br>
